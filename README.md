Welcome to the official VirManDC repository. The code and resources found here correspond to the September 2023 version, to be delivered as part of the Master's Thesis of the MUEI of the UDC.

## What is VirManDC?
Its acronym stands for Virtual Management Data Center. It is a open-source application for HoloLens 2 capable of representing the graphical model of a Data Center and displaying the information associated with each server monitored by a Zabbix service through its API.
